## Abstract

Typical present-day CPUs have two or more levels of caches. This article provides basic
insight into their operation and presents key architectural properties which suggest
possible program optimizations.  The abstract external memory model (EMM) for memory
hierarchies and the cache-oblivious model (COM) derived from it are presented briefly.
