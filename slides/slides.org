* Hardware Caches
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Store subset of data from slower storage
  - Managed by hardware
  - Small
  - Fast

** Why though?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Fast is pricey
     - SRAM
   - Slow is cheap
     - DRAM
   - Speed of light

** 
   \begin{align*}
   \frac{3\cdot10^8 \text{ m/s}}{3 \text{ GHz}} = 10 \text{ cm}
   \end{align*}
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   \rightarrow 5 cm add more than one cycle of latency.

** Types
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Data cache
   - Instruction cache
   - Translation lookaside buffer (TLB)

** Levels
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   Typically 2 or 3 on x86
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - L1d and L1i
     - Split and private
   - L2
     - Unified and shared
   - L3
     - Unified and shared

   | 32-64 KiB | 256-512 KiB | 2-16 MiB |

** Reading cache sizes
   #+NAME: lscpu
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports both :results output code :eval no-export
   lscpu | grep 'L1\|L2\|L3'
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS: lscpu
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   L1d cache:             32K
   L1i cache:             32K
   L2 cache:              512K

   | 3-4 | 10-12 | 30-70 |     100-150 |

** Verify?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - Randomly access memory
     \to each access is to a different cache line
   - Measure CPU cycles with hardware performance counter
   - Vary working set size

** TLB
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Suppose a 4-level page table and an L1d access time of 3 cycles:
   virtual to physical address translation takes at least 12 cycles
   (that's without L1d misses).  Maybe draw an illustration on the
   blackboard.
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   These accesses cannot be parallelized since they depend on the
   previous lookup’s result.

   - Caching page tables doesn't work out: page walk through multi-level table is still slow\\

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t

** Cache Line
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - The unit of data transfer between cache and main memory
   - 64 bytes on x86
     #+NAME: getconf
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports both :results output code :eval no-export
     getconf LEVEL1_DCACHE_LINESIZE; getconf LEVEL2_CACHE_LINESIZE

     64
     #+END_SRC

     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
     \to Load one ~int~, get another 15 +for free+
   - Both cache and main memory can be thought of as being partitioned
     into cache lines

* 
  Same program as [[#access-times][before]], only the shuffle is removed
   
  #+BEGIN_SRC C
    #define N 100000000  // 100 million

    struct elem {
       struct elem *next;
    } array[SIZE];

    int main() {
       for (size_t i = 0; i < SIZE - 1; ++i) array[i].next = &array[i + 1];
       array[SIZE - 1].next = array;
    #ifndef BASELINE
       int64_t dummy = 0;
       struct elem *i = array;
       for (size_t n = 0; n < N; ++n) {
	  dummy += (int64_t)i;
	  i = i->next;
       }
       printf("%ld\n", dummy);

    }

** Compared to random access
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none none none appear) :fragidx (- - - 1)
   - L1 is the same: 3 cycles
   - L2 only takes 1 more cycle: 4 instead of 25
   - Main memory takes about 6 cycles: ~3% of random access time
   - /Some/ of this is better use of cache lines
     - Only one access for 8 elements \to at best down to 12.5%

** Prefetching
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
   - Technique by which CPUs predict access patterns and preemptively push cache lines up the memory hierarchy
   - Predictable basically means linear
   - Done asynchronously to normal program execution\\
     \to Can almost completely hide main memory latency

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
   Why isn't that happening?

*** Why isn't that happening?
    Performance is still memory bound
    
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
    \to Measure after adding some expensive operations\\
    (2 integer division each iteration)
    #+REVEAL: split
    # #+CAPTION: CPU-Bound sequential access
    [[file:cpu-bound-seq-access-time-plot.png]]
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Prefetching has one big weakness: it cannot cross page
    boundaries. -- Drepper
    #+END_QUOTE
    - Every 4 KiB, there's a TLB miss
      - \(4\text{ KiB} / 8\text {B} = 0.5\cdot 2^{10} = 512\)
      - May cause several accesses that incur the full main memory latency
    #+END_NOTES

* Locality of Reference
  - Cache-friendliness of code depends on two main properties:
    - /Temporal locality/
    - /Spatial locality/
  - Both are measures of how well the code's memory access pattern matches certain principles

** Temporal Locality
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
   - One access suggests another
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag T
     - Once referenced memory locations tend to be used again within a short time frame
   - Without this, memory hierarchies would be pretty pointless
     - When a cache line is loaded but not accessed again before being evicted, the cache provided no benefit

** Spatial Locality
   1. For each accessed memory location, nearby locations are used as well within a short time frame
   2. Memory is accessed sequentially
      
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
   We have already seen in the last two sections that caches take advantage of both these principles by design:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   1. Data is loaded in blocks; subsequent accesses to locations in an already loaded cache line are basically free
   2. Cache lines from sequential access patterns are prefetched ahead of time
      
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Access to instructions inherently has good spatial locality since
   they are executed sequentially outside of jumps, and good temporal
   locality because of loops and function calls.
   #+END_NOTES

* ~std::vector~ vs. ~std::list~
  - Initialize a bunch of C++ STL containers with random values
  - Measure CPU time for summing all of them
  - Both variants' time complexity is \Theta(N)
  - What is the performance difference when using ~std::vector~ compared to
    using ~std::list~?
    
  #+REVEAL: split
  #+BEGIN_SRC cpp
    constexpr int N = 5000;

    int main() {
       Container containers[N];
       std::srand(std::time(nullptr));
       // Append an average of 5000 random values to each container.
       for (int i = 0; i < N * 5000; ++i) {
	  containers[std::rand() % N].push_back(std::rand());
       }

       int sum = 0;
       std::clock_t t0 = std::clock();
       for (int m = 0; m < N; ++m) {
	  for (int num : containers[m]) {
	     sum += num;
	  }
       }
       std::clock_t t1 = std::clock();

       // Also print the sum so the loop doesn't get optimized out.
       std::cout << sum << '\n' << (t1 - t0) << '\n';
    }

** Result
   #+NAME: get-speedup
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash :exports none :cache yes :results output verbatim
   awk '{ print int($1+0.5) }' ../ithare/speedup.txt 
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS[097a81ed9983614afb304cf7c0ebbe986c1411de]: get-speedup
   : 152

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none appear)
   - Computing the sum runs call_get-speedup() {{{results(=152=)}}}
     times faster when using ~std::vector~
   - The list has /some/ space overhead since it stores two pointers and
     some more overhead because of indirection
   - The more cache-friendly access pattern of ~std::vector~ is decisive, though

** "True" OO Style
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear) :fragidx
   - Everything has a polymorphic class type
   - Now we can store different objects that only have the same base class in
     one container
   - We have to use pointers of course
   - Our flat vector or array just turned into this:
