\section{Example: \texttt{std::vector} vs. \texttt{std::list}}
\label{sec:lvv}

\alts{%
   The \cpp{} program shown in \cref{lst:ithare},
   The following \cpp{} program,
}%
, adapted from \textcite{bigos}, initializes a number of \acrshort{stl} containers
with random numbers and measures the processor time needed to \alts{sum all of them,
compute the sum}.
%
I first ran it with \mintinline{cpp}{Container} being a type alias for
\mintinline{cpp}{std::list}, then for \mintinline{cpp}{std::vector}.%
\footnote{%
   Each compiled with \x{the \gls{gcc}} and \mintinline{text}{-O3} and
   \mintinline{text}{-march=native}
}
Either way, the asymptotic complexity is \(\Theta(N)\).

\alts{My, The} result is that computing the sum \alts{runs, is} \num[round-mode=places,
round-precision=0]{\speedup} times faster when using \mintinline{cpp}{std::vector}.  Some
of this difference can \x{certainly} be attributed to space overhead of the linked list
and the added indirection, but the more cache-friendly memory access pattern of
\mintinline{cpp}{std::vector} is \alts{decisive, key, crucial, vital}~\cite[5\psq]{bigos}.
Using \mintinline{cpp}{std::list} incurs \say{random access to memory} in this
example~\cite[6]{bigos}.

\subsection{Notes}

\subsubsection{``True'' OO Style}

% TODO.  Having a vector of pointers to dynamically allocated object derived from some
% base class in true OO style (tm) probably isn't going to make the cache happy.  Bjarne
% Stroustrup talked about this [1].  Strongly related: data-oriented design [3].

% A nice compact, flat container isn't going to cut it if it contains pointers.

In \gls{oo} systems, variables are typically referred to by pointers to a common base
class.  A polymorphic container of such pointers allows for dynamic dispatch of virtual
functions.  However, this carries the risk of degrading the \x{superior} performance of a
sequential data structure to that of a list%

\subsubsection{Unrolled List}

% TODO.  Talk about unrolled lists and software prefetching.
